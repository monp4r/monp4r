### Hi there, I'm Juan Francisco Montero 👋

I'm a Maths and Software Engineering student, passionate about Cibersecurity 🛡️. I enjoy securing and building scalable applications, improving and optimizing processes. Additionally, I have an interest in exploring vulnerabilities in weak websites to enhance their security.

- 🌱 As I said before, I'm currently pursuing **Double Degree in Software Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Valladolid**.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I **strongly** believe in the *Butterfly Effect*: Tiny actions can wield mighty consequences. Just as a butterfly's wings shape distant weather patterns, I recognize the deep link between everyday choices and enduring impacts. 🦋
- :bulb: I'm interested in the latest technologies in IT: **Cybersecurity, Cloud, Front and Back Web Development and Machine Learning**.
- 💬 Talk to me about Formula 1 :racing_car:, Padel, Memes, Movies 🎥, Waiting to play GTA VI! 🎮, Trying to lead a healthier life. 🫀

Currently, I'm actively **looking for internship opportunities** as part of my dual degree program. My aim is to **apply my academic knowledge in a real-world work setting**, make a positive contribution to a team, and develop practical business skills. I'm focused on finding a position that offers valuable experience and facilitates my professional growth in the business field.
